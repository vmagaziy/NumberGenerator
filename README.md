# Number Generator

Small application for iOS which allows to generate random numbers

## Environment and Coding Considerations

* Xcode 6.1.1 running on OS X 10.10.1 is used as a developer environment
* Cocoa Pods v0.34.0 gem installed
* Application is not specifically tailored to iPad specifics and can be run on iOS 7 or higher
* Code is written using Swift
* Localization is done using `NSLocalizedString`

## Build Instructions

After checking out make sure to run `pod install` to install used **Cocoa Pods**

## Test Harness

Only [small](http://googletesting.blogspot.co.uk/2010/12/test-sizes.html) or unit tests are implemented

## Additional Notes

* Style of application may be easily changed by tweaking so called brand colours
* Style of carousel for numbers can also be easily changed by using different [iCarousel types](https://github.com/nicklockwood/iCarousel)
* Number of generated numbers and their range can be changed easily as well

## What's next

* Application icon is to be designed
